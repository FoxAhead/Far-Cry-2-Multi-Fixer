# Far Cry 2 Multi Fixer

Applying fixes for Far Cry 2 is usually associated with editing the executable files of the game (in particular, the game engine Dunia.dll). The disadvantages of this approach are obvious: the changes are fixed in the file, various mod makers change the files at their discretion and offer to overwrite them, it is difficult to track which patches you have now applied, and, in the end, they can simply disappear after the overwriting, for example, after checking the integrity of the local files of the game on Steam or reinstalling. The solution to this problem is not to change the files themselves, but to make changes to the process memory at runtime.

This utility is just designed to run the game and make modifications on the fly without physically changing the game files. In addition to patches, there are also options for command line parameters, for example, to skip intro movies or to restrict FPS or enable cheats.

## Usage
Download the ZIP archive from the release section.

Unpack two files somewhere: `FarCry2MFLauncher.exe` and `FarCry2MF.dll` - into a separate folder or directly into the folder with the game, as long as these two files are together in one folder. Run `FarCry2MFLauncher.exe`:

The program will automatically determine the location of the game and display it on top. Just press the `Play` button.

By clicking the Options button, all options with a description are available for configuration:

By default, only the most necessary options are enabled.

In order not to run the utility each time, you can create a shortcut to launch it. To do this, click the `Create shortcut...` and save the shortcut in a convenient place for you.

Through this shortcut, the game will start immediately without having to press `Play`.

## Compatibility
